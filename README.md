Machine Learning (ML) has become core field within area of artificial intelligence. It allows
systems to learn and detect patterns and make decisions without needing external
programming. The success of any ML model depends heavily on the choice of algorithm and
how well its optimization work. Traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machines,
Decision Trees, and Neural Networks have shown strong predictive abilities. However, they
often struggle with issues like overfitting, slow convergence, and high computational
demands and underfitting. As datasets become larger and more complex, the need for new
algorithms and better optimization methods increases. Optimization is crucial for improving
model accuracy, slicing down training time, and enhancing generalization. This study looks
into new machine learning algos and modern optimization techniques, including metaheuristic and probabilistic methods, to tackle current issues in model training and parameter
tuning. The goal is to explore how optimized learning strategies can create more efficient,
strong, and flexible machine learning systems that can be used in various real-world fields
